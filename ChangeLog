	* Added new script frm2mpeg.sh

2007-01-15  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V93

	* Removed all SetPal() calls in favor of just swapping the
	palette in av_sync() where the pixel magic happens

	* Replaced a bunch of locally defined structures as PatchHdr and 
	SimpleHdr and added the appropriate Endian swap.

	* Moved endian related headers into endianness.h

	* Replaced all endian related defines with __BIG_ENDIAN__
	

2007-01-14  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V92

	* MAC: More endian changes to get most of the Astronaut related areas
	working

2007-01-14  Krzysztof Kosciuszkiewicz <drvee@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V91

	* Action in Replay() can be now skipped with mouse button.

	* Prestige firsts are properly shown.

	* Fixed a bug in av_sync(), now if there is no reason to repaint the
	screen it is not done.

	* Used qsort() in OrderMissions().

2007-01-14  Krzysztof Kosciuszkiewicz <drvee@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V90

	* Fixed AstFaces(), re-indented. Faces display correctly.

2007-01-14  Krzysztof Kosciuszkiewicz <drvee@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V89

	* Fixed off-by-one rectangle filling bug in gr.c

	* Fixed unnecessary redraws in Future(), re-indented.

2007-01-12  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V88

	* MAC: Missions now play all the way through, need to work on the replay next.

2007-01-12  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V87

	* MAC: Lots of stuff working now, right up to the launch of the missions

	* Commented out a few assertions in gx.c, the params were valid and I'll 
	have to recheck the assertion later
	
	* Modified checkin2 to show diffstat only and not include it in the checking comments

2007-01-12  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V86

	* Fixed an assertion in grGetPixel()

	* Fixed a crash in Future Missions when mousing over the bubbles

	* Removed some unused local variables in port.c

2007-01-12  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V85

	* Forgot to actually add the diffstat results to the checkin

2007-01-12  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V84

	* Modified checkin2 to use diffstat if it's available and append
	the results to the checkin comment

	* Modified checkin1 and removed the '-c' parameter allowing cvs to
	use defaults from .cvsrc without conflicts

2007-01-12  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V83

	* Lots of work on the Mac port, still a work in progress. At least the
	spaceport works and a the Help text.

	* Lots of additional cleanup in the Spaceport code and variable renaming
	especially the very confusing PreOut. Renamed it to pPortOutlineRestore and
	allocated it dynamically instead of having it tacked onto a buffer.  

2007-01-12  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V82

	* AdminPort and NPPort where almost the same.  I removed AdminPort() 
	since it was used to paint the Spaceport under the Admin screen text
	and kept NPPort (removing the fades) figuring it's the more accurate as 
	it's the one that's actually used for the spaceport.  So renamed 
	NPPort() to DrawSpaceport() and added fades around a call to 
	DrawSpaceport() where calls to NPPort used to be.

	* Removed a few 'return;' statements from the end of void functions.

2007-01-12  Krzysztof Kosciuszkiewicz <drvee@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V81

	* Changed & optimized av_sync to keep track of changed pixels.
	Now only parts of the screen are updated during redraw (if possible).
	This can get further iff drawing code will use gr & gx routines instead
	of direct memory access.

	* Fixed issues with off-by-one errors in data files. Is it just my copy
	that is broken?

	* Added .indent.pro file with options for indent(1).

	* Added rules to build tags and TAGS files.

2007-01-11  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V80

	* Renamed the Spaceport enums since I found an area where the
	OVL_ scheme didn't make sense, changed to PORT_, it's a little
	more understandable now.

	* Added a comment to fn PortSel() mentioning basically that it's the
	jumping off point for each module.

2007-01-11  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V79

	* Added enums for the Spaceport improvements

2007-01-11  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

2007-01-10  Krzysztof Kosciuszkiewicz <drvee@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V75

	* minn() and maxx() macros fixed (!!!)

	* Functions in gx.c are now optimized and detect bad arguments

	* Memory overrun fixes in main.c, prefs.c, news.c, port.c, vab.c,
	place.c, museum.c, hardef.c, intel.c

	* "Patches" do not work properly right now, why?

2007-01-10  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V74

	* Removed all references to 'far', yanked that and 'pascal' from the Makefile

2007-01-10  Krzysztof Kosciuszkiewicz <drvee@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V73

	* Fixed DoCycle(), water now flows in the right direction

2007-01-10  Krzysztof Kosciuszkiewicz <drvee@users.sourceforge.net>

	* More endian changes to move the Mac PPC port along

2007-01-09  Krzysztof Kosciuszkiewicz <drvee@users.sourceforge.net> -- via Michael McCarty

	* V66

	* eliminates SIGSEGV in frm_open_seq by initializing frm_tbl safely

	* V65

	* Added a patch to allow the press and hold of the mouse button to
	see astronaut stats

2007-01-08  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V64

	* Fixed up endian changes on the linux build

2007-01-08  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V63

	* Finished SwapGameDat() for initial data load

2007-01-08  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V62

	* Made earlier changes unbreak the linux compile.  I should really start checking
	this before I check things in.
		
2007-01-08  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V61

	* Removed all MouseOn() and MouseOff() calls

2007-01-08  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V60

	* Renamed recods.c to records.c

2007-01-08  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V59

	* Work on the MacOSX builds:  Added SwapLong/SwapWord and a palette swap

	* Mac: Currently the intro images display with the proper colors.

2007-01-08  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V58

	* Fixed a problem I introduced in configure.in

2007-01-08  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V57

	* Added define to the autoconf for MACOSX when the host
	OS is Darwin.  Also added "race.h" as a general include for
	everything so these defines can be used globally

2007-01-07  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V56

	* Modify configure.in and a few sources to check for __APPLE__
	at compile time.  I'd like to work off a MACOSX define but couldn't
	figure out how to get that defined from within the autoconf.  
	__APPLE__ could theoretically include non OSX Mac's

	* Modified configure.in to use sdl-config on mingw platform.

2007-01-07  Pace Willisson  <pace@rhino.pacew.com>

	* V55
	
	* don't exit on CDAccess calls

	* V54
	
	* basic support for cross compiling for windows; use autoconf
	

2007-01-06  Pace Willisson  <pace@rhino.pacew.com>

	* V53
	
	* protect against null pointer

	* V52
	
	* automatically save game into "autosave.sav" every turn

	* V51

	* put some av_block() calls in to keep it from wasting the
	cpu when waiting for keyboard input; don't wave flag over
	text on admin screen

	* V50
	
	* handle the situation where the video runs out before the
	audio a little better

2007-01-03  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V49

	* Fixed an off by one in the main data structure when replacing hard coded
	values with definitions

2007-01-03  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V48

	* Replaced fixed value in for_each_player loops with NUM_PLAYERS define

2007-01-03  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V47

	* Added data_defs.h to hold common program definitions like NUM_PLAYERS and MAX_MISSIONS
	to possibly make this easier to increase players and missions in the future.

	* Checked uninits in aipur.c and formatted code

2007-01-03  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* V46

	* verified XXX marked code in future.c

2007-01-03  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V45

	* verified non initialized prestige estimator variable in budget.c

	* Added to QUESTIONS and TODO

2007-01-03  Pace Willisson  <pace@rhino.pacew.com>

	* V44

	* support blocking for X events or time going by, instead of
	always running at about 30 frames per second; try to recognize
	when we are falling behind on the newscaster animation and skip
	frames to catch up; remove some dead code; add dbg() function
	from libopus which prints nice timestamps on log messages; improve
	animation handling in port.c so it doesn't waste so much cpu time; 

2007-01-03  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V43

	* Changed DEVELOPER to reflect the repository name change

2007-01-03  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V42

	* Renamed UpdatePort to UpdatePortOverlays to avoid a Macintosh name conflict

2007-01-03  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V41

	* Encapsulated the creation of ENDGAME.TMP into a single function.
	* Turned off save game encryption.  Move it into an #ifdef for
	historical purposes.

2007-01-03  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V40

	* Removed the macosx directory so there isn't false hope

2007-01-03  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* V39

	* fixed some unitialized values

	* replaced calls to kill() with remove_savedat()

2007-01-02  Pace Willisson  <pace@rhino.pacew.com>

	* V38

	* rpm file generation

	* V37

	* allow videos to be skipped when viewing missions

	* V36
	
	* make little screens work during launch

	* V35
	
	* remove stubs that are no longer needed (now unimp() is gone);
	remove modem and play by mail stuff until everything else works

	* V34
	
	* hack around messed up crane image (search for fixing sImg) in
	port.c

	* V33
	
	* fix some NULL pointer problems in mc.c and prest.c

	* V32

	* enable gcc warning related to structured initializers

	* V31
	
	* enable gcc warning about comparing signed and unsigned values
		
	* V30
	
	* enable gcc check for use of uninitialized local
	variable - put in lots of comments like this:

	 spc[0] = 0; /* XXX check uninitialized */

	 Some of these are real bugs, where there was no way to initialize
	the variable before it was used.  In other cases, the code path
	that gcc found to an uninitialized use may be impossible to
	traverse given other data constraints.  Future project:
	look for all these comments and either fix any bugs present,
	or remove the comment if the code is ok.
	
	* V29
	
	* add extra braces and parens so gcc's Wparentheses warning
	will be useful.  I compiled the program before and after
	these changes with no difference in the .o files, so the
	explicit groups is now what the compiler has done all along.
	there were two paces in future.c, marked with XXX, where
	the indenting suggested that the other order was intended -
	this is worth checking

	* V28

	* the ai was looping forever in RDafford because roll was
	negative due to Manned Safety being more than MaxRD.  the
	dos game survived this because roll was a 16 bit number,
	so it didn't take to long to count it down until it wrapped
	to 0.  but it was never going to finish with a 32 bit roll value

	for now, delcare roll as i16 to make it behave a least as well as dos...

	remove calls to inp() that checked for vblank

	change WORD to i16 to make Spot data structures work

	enable SPOT_ON visuals.  sound will come later; I've seen some
	helicoptors, but no vehicle assembly yet

	* V27

	* remaining unsued locals

	* V26

	* another block of unused locals

	* V25
	
	* remove more unused locals

	* V24

	* I messed up trying to apply tag V23 to Michael's changes.
	This check just puts V24 on the current files.

2007-01-02  Michael McCarty <k6mmc@users.sourceforge.net>

	* V23

	* added BARIS_ROOT envorinment variable so GAMEDAT and ROM assets
	can exist on a local disk

	* Removed definition of _ExceptInit(void) which was originally used to 
	trim unused Borland C exception code and reduce code size 

2007-01-02  Pace Willisson  <pace@rhino.pacew.com>

	* V22
	
	* remove remaining ems stuff; remove libopus references; fix
	credits; re-enable water flowing

	* V21
	
	* enable mission failures (and make command line arg to force all
	to succeed again); allow jumbled arg order in draw/clear rectangle;
	give symbolic names to xMODE flags (for cloud testing); failure
	animation; data type size problem reading NTABLE.DAT; 

	* V20
	
	* remove deadwood

	* V19
	
	* a few notes in README

	* V18
	
	* improve finding files on cdrom; move savedat to ~/.raceintospace;
	put music files in /usr/share/raceintospace/music

2007-01-01  Pace Willisson  <pace@rhino.pacew.com>

	* V17

	* clean up timers and frame rate; improve mouse click handling;
	remove play by mail and modem choices; make flag waving and
	water flowing work;
	
	* V16
	
	* remove unused files

	* V15
	
	* add music

	* V14
	
	* add audio to mission playback

	* V13
	
	* make mission display work; fix up inter-frame delays in video;

	* V12

	* switch from gtk to sdl; make use of toupper safe against
	values outside of unsigned char range; put some sleeps
	in when waiting for input

	* V11
	
	* fix display in VAB; some other helper programs

	* V10
	
	* more pathname details

	* V9

	* pathname handling

	* V8
	
	* PlaySequence, Replay
	
	* change "kill()" to "remove_savegame()"

	* remove uses of SetROMDir, chdir, unlink

2006-12-31  Pace Willisson  <pace@rhino.pacew.com>

	* V7
	
	* old bug: initialization of FList when looking for saved games

	* frm decoding; first page of mission history screen (with
	still image from movie)

2006-12-30  Pace Willisson  <pace@rhino.pacew.com>

	* V6
	
	* change many RLED to RLED_img
