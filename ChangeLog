	* V28

	* the ai was looping forever in RDafford because roll was
	negative due to Manned Safety being more than MaxRD.  the
	dos game survived this because roll was a 16 bit number,
	so it didn't take to long to count it down until it wrapped
	to 0.  but it was never going to finish with a 32 bit roll value

	for now, delcare roll as i16 to make it behave a least as well as dos...

	remove calls to inp() that checked for vblank

	change WORD to i16 to make Spot data structures work

	enable SPOT_ON visuals.  sound will come later; I've seen some
	helicoptors, but no vehicle assembly yet
