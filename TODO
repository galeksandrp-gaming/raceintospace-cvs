BUGS
====

These should be fixed as soon as possible as they crash the binary or
seriously affect gameplay.

 * [7] mc2.c(MisDur): segfault for (some?) joint missions.
 * [5] endgame.c(EndPict): segfault.
 * [5] news video is not clipped, green band appears (pace, linux).
 * [3] aipur.c(RDafford):562, class == 2 && MaxRD == 80 && Safety == 90 (???).

NOT IMPLEMENTED
===============

Features present in the original BARIS but not implemented or not working
properly in Race Into Space.

 * [5] Autosave does work, but reloading the game after failures does not
 bring back the prestige lost (look at president's ranking).
 * [5] Configuration option for still images instead of videos (do we need it?)

ENCHANCEMENTS
=============

Incremental enchancements that would improve quality of software but do not
change anything considered essential to playability. This includes code
refactoring as well.

 * [9] Reduce dependencies between game logic and game engine.
 * [5] Remove temporary files on exit.
 * [5] Remove extra gr_sync calls.
 * [5] Preload next frame during mission playback.
 * [5] Newscaster animations and sounds should be better synced.
 * [5] Music is too loud during newscasts (pace, linux)
 * [5] Bar graphs during mission tests pause audio and video.
 * [5] Baby pictures shown on missions are downsampled and upsampled.
 * [3] Optimize grPutPixel and grGetPixel (I'm not sure it's needed)
 * [3] Clipping in gx* routines.

EXTENSIONS
==========

Improvements that might change rules and/or gameplay balance.

 * Plenty of them, just look at
 http://www.baris-online.net/wiki/index.php/Enhancements

CODE REFACTORING
================

 * [9] Comment undocumented game-logic structures.
 * [7] Remove "magic numbers" (at least as many as possible).
 * [7] Reduce number and visibility of global variables, rename some.
 * [7] Move game strings into a separate string table or file.
 * [5] Clean up header files, separate functionality.
 * [5] Factor video display code out from mis_c.c and replay.c

OTHER IDEAS
===========

 * Release checklist: valgrind, electric fence, CFLAGS=-O2 -DNDEBUG
Everything that does not fit into previous sections.
