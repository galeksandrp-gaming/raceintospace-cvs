on a mission failure, replay mission doesn't show the explosion

I think that drawing the bar graph also runs the cpu flat out

I'm not seeing the prestige screen for Russian firsts

In astronaut complex, if you visit Capsule training, you can't 
get back by clicking Continue with the mouse.  You can get back
by typing Enter.

in the baby screens, don't down sample then up sample

=======
wastes cpu time when showing the new image

drop frames if getting behind on newscaster or movie playback

look into "hold frame" stuff for aligning mission video and audio

fades
implement config opts for no anim

clean up extra gr_sync's

================================================================
enhancements:

optimize grPutPixel and grGetPixel

the gx routines should clip - thats easy, but right now they
make assertions about arguments. Problem fixed in port.c

astronauts faces and patches are not displayed properly

screen clearing is not perfect while overwriting existing strings,
this can be seen in news (comma char), astronauts screens, future
missions, intelligence etc.

try mpeg encoding the video

Yank strings into a separate string table

================================================================
possible old bugs

in RDafford, figure out how this came to be MaxRD = 80, but Safety = 90 once:
 if (class==2) roll+=Data->P[plr].Manned[index].MaxRD - Data->P[plr].Manned[index].Safety;

================================================================
CODE MAINTENANCE

Clean up header files.

Reduce global variables, most should be static anyway.

Comment mysterious bits & pieces.

Remove "magic numbers", change to #defines or enums.

Comment important data structures.

Introduce less cryptic names for some variables, especially globals!

BIG THING: Separate game logic and AI from every other stuff
================================================================

release checklist

check with valgrind
compile with -O
compile with -DNDEBUG
