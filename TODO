on a mission failure, replay mission doesn't show the explosion

I think that drawing the bar graph also runs the cpu flat out

I'm not seeing the prestige screen for Russian firsts

In astronaut complex, if you visit Capsule training, you can't 
get back by clicking Continue with the mouse.  You can get back
by typing Enter.

in the baby screens, don't down sample then up sample

=======
when updating the x server, scan top and bottom of the previous
and current image for identical parts, then send just the middle
part that has changed

wastes cpu time when showing the new image

drop frames if getting behind on newscaster or movie playback

look into "hold frame" stuff for aligning mission video and audio


remove SetROMDir

fades
implement config opts for no sound, no anim

implement PlayAudio ... summing sound effects with music

clean up extra gr_sync's

================================================================
enhancements:

water seems to flow backwards in DoCycle
optimize grPutPixel and grGetPixel

I started the game and it happend that a plane flew by on the first view
of the space port.  I never typed anything, but later I noticed that there
was a plane stuck to the left edge of the screen.  It disappeared after I
switched to another screen (R&D), then back to the port.

=> the probem is that the gx routines should clip - we're seeing the
wrapped image

try mpeg encoding the video

Yank strings into a separate string table

================================================================
possible old bugs

in RDafford, figure out how this came to be MaxRD = 80, but Safety = 90 once:
 if (class==2) roll+=Data->P[plr].Manned[index].MaxRD - Data->P[plr].Manned[index].Safety;

================================================================

release checklist

check with valgrind
compile with -O
