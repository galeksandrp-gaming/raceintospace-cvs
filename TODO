\section bugs BUGS

These should be fixed as soon as possible as they crash the binary or
seriously affect gameplay.

 \bug * [5] news video is not clipped, green band appears (pace, linux).

 \bug * [3] aipur.c(RDafford):562, class == 2 && MaxRD == 80 && Safety == 90 (???).

\section notimplemented NOT IMPLEMENTED

Features present in the original BARIS but not implemented or not working
properly in Race Into Space.

 \todo * [5] Autosave does work, but reloading the game after failures does not
 bring back the prestige lost (look at president's ranking).

 \todo * [5] Configuration option for still images instead of videos (do we need it?)

\section enhancements ENCHANCEMENTS

Incremental enchancements that would improve quality of software but do not
change anything considered essential to playability. This includes code
refactoring as well.

 \todo * [9] Reduce dependencies between game logic and game engine.

 \todo * [5] Remove temporary files on exit.
 
 \todo * [5] Remove extra gr_sync calls.

 \todo * [5] Preload next frame during mission playback.

\section refactor CODE REFACTORING

 \todo * [9] Comment undocumented game-logic structures.

 \todo * [7] Reduce number and visibility of global variables, rename some.

 \todo * [7] Move game strings into a separate string table or file.

 \todo * [5] Clean up header files, separate functionality.

 \todo * [5] Factor video display code out from mis_c.c and replay.c

\section other OTHER IDEAS

 \todo * Release checklist: valgrind, electric fence, CFLAGS=-O2 -DNDEBUG
Everything that does not fit into previous sections.
