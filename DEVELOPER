compiling on linux:

$ autoconf
$ configure
$ make

================================================================

cross compiling linux -> windows:

1. install the cross compiler as described at:

http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/README.txt

2. download SDL:

http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.11-mingw32.tar.gz

copy SDL-1.2.11/lib/* from this tar file into 
/usr/local/cross/i386-mingw32msvc/lib

(the SDL include files apparantly come from the host environment - 
dangerous, but it works)

3. download SDL runtime:

http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.11-win32.zip

extract SDL.dll from this and put it in raceintospace source directory

4. compile

run "autoconf" as a normal linux program
run "cross-configure.sh"
run "cross-make.sh"

5. run (I'm using wine-0.9.27 on Fedora core 5)

get the wine environment initialized with "wine notepad", then

mkdir ~/.wine/drive_c/raceintospace

copy all of the cdrom data to ~/.wine/drive_c/raceintospace/cdrom

music isn't supported yet, but when it is, copy all of the ogg
compressed music files to

~/.wine/drive_c/raceintospace/music

run

wine ./raceintospace.exe


================================================================
for making rpm's

useful instructions:
	https://pmc.ucsc.edu/~dmk/notes/RPMs/Creating_RPMs.html

install rpmdevtools from fedora

run rpmdev-setuptree to make a build environment in your home
directory

create ~/.rpmmacros as:

%_topdir /home/race/rpmbuild
%_tmppath /home/race/rpmbuild/tmp

then, run the script "mkrpm"
