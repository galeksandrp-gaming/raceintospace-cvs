To run the game:

Make a directory /usr/share/raceintospace/cdrom and put the files from
the original cdrom there.  So, for example, you should have the file
/usr/share/raceintospace/cdrom/gamedat/unews.cdr The program is
tolerant of whether the file names are in upper or lower case.

Put the music files in /usr/share/raceintospace/music This will be
done automatically if you install the rpm file.  If not, you can get
music.tar.gz from the Sourceforge project at

	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=129186

To compile, simply type "make".

The executable program is "raceintospace" which doesn't require any
arguments.

Your saved games will be written to $HOME/.raceintospace
