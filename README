    Race Into Space is distributed under GNU General Pulic License (GPL)
    version 2. You can find the terms and conditions in file COPYING.

1. Running the game

    If you have downloaded the source distribution then see DEVELOPER file.
    Follow on once you have the game executables ready.

    Try to run the game, it will probably complain about missing
    data files. This should not happen if you have downloaded and
    properly installed one of binary distributions (ie. RPM or windows
    installer). If you have built the game from source then get the
    data files from http://sf.net/projects/raceintospace/

    Once you have your data files extracted, edit the file
    ~/.raceintospace/config - it will be created when you start
    the game for the first time. Hopefully the file format is
    self-explanatory.  By the way, your saved games will be stored
    in the same directory (~/.raceintospace)

    Alternatively you can specify location of configuration directory
    and game data directory with environment variables BARIS_SAVE
    and BARIS_DATA, respectively. These are also supported when
    present on the command line, ie:

    $ raceintospace BARIS_DATA=$HOME/baris/

    Good luck on your way to the Moon!

2. Troubleshooting

    Probably you will run into some bugs, at least if you play
    the game long enough. To help us improve raceintospace please
    try to find a way to reproduce the crash and email it to
    kmccarty@raceintospace.org, possibly accompanied by a save game
    file and your system information (libraries, etc.)

3. Development: see file DEVELOPER.
