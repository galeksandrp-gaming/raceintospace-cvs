    Race  Into Space  is distributed  under GNU  General Public  License
    (GPL)  version 2. You  can find  the  terms and  conditions in  file
    COPYING.

1. Running the game

    If you  have downloaded the  source distribution then  see DEVELOPER
    file.  Follow on once you have the game executables ready.

    Try  to  run the  game,  it  will  probably complain  about  missing
    data  files.  This  should not  happen  if you  have downloaded  and
    properly installed  one of binary distributions  (ie. RPM or windows
    installer). If you have built the game from source then get the data
    files from http://sf.net/projects/raceintospace/

    Once   you  have   your  data   files  extracted,   edit  the   file
    ~/.raceintospace/config - it will be created when you start the game
    for the  first time. Hopefully the file  format is self-explanatory.
    By the  way, your saved games  will be stored in  the same directory
    (~/.raceintospace)

    Alternatively you  can specify  location of  configuration directory
    and game  data directory  with environment variables  BARIS_SAVE and
    BARIS_DATA, respectively. These  are also supported when  present on
    the command line, ie:

    $ raceintospace BARIS_DATA=$HOME/baris BARIS_SAVE=$HOME/baris/saves

    Good luck on your way to the Moon!

1a. Running on Microsoft Windows platforms.

    On Windows  error messages  will go to  the stderr.txt  file created
    in  the working  directory  (usually the  directory  where the  main
    executable resides). Whenever  the game  crashes or  misbehaves look
    for clues in that file.

    The installer  creates shortcuts  with location  of game  data files
    provided on  the command  line. Location of  save game  directory is
    obtained using environment variables  HOME, HOMEPATH and USERPROFILE
    (in that order). Users reported that  on Windows 98 neither of those
    is set  by default.  To solve  this problem either set  one of above
    variables  or edit  the  game shortcut's  command  line and  provide
    desired location for save games, ie:

    "c:\program files\raceintospace\raceintospace.exe"
    "BARIS_DATA=c:\program files\raceintospace"
    "BARIS_SAVE=c:\program files\raceintospace\saves"

2. Troubleshooting

    Probably you will run into some bugs,  at least if you play the game
    long enough. To help  us improve raceintospace please try  to find a
    way  to reproduce  it and  submit a  bug report  via the  Tracker at
    http://sf.net/projects/raceintospace/ possibly accompanied by a save
    game  file  and  your  system information  (os  version,  libraries,
    environment variables, command line arguments, etc.)
