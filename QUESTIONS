Shall we rip out the calls to MouseOn and MouseOff?  The window system
does all this work now, so these functions are no-ops.  It might be
tempting to think that leaving them in could be useful if we wanted to
run on bare hardware again, but since they aren't in use now, it would
be pretty likely that bugs would be introduced before the unlikely
time that they would be needed.  I think the simplification would
be worthwhile.



The frame rate in the FRM files seems to be 8, which means 8 frames
per second, right?
- I think this is right.

RLE bug
-What's this?  I'm sending you a link to SV_LIB source that has a commented RLED

how fast is BzTimer?
-It's 5000 ms, or 5 seconds.  That stuff was handled by the Miles audio library to keep the audio buffer full.

what is DoCycle supposed to do?
- This is a little bit of color cycling on the space ports.  It's just shuffling some colors around
